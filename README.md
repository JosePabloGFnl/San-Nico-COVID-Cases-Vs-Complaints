# San Nicolas de los Garza - COVID Cases vs. Complaints per Affected Legal Good

This repository is done with the purpose of completing a project task for a course. The main focus was to find an analysis problem to be plotted based on a city we're familiar with. For which, I chose San Nicolas de los Garza, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
The problem is to find a correlation between increase of COVID cases and a crime measurement in the city during a certain period of time so we can draw conclusions from that.
